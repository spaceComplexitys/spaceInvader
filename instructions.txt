5. Use Rosetta 2 as a Last Resort

If you cannot resolve the architecture issue, you can compile and run your program under Rosetta 2, which emulates the x86_64 architecture on M1 Macs:
1.	Install x86_64 versions of the libraries:


arch -x86_64 brew install glfw glew


2.	Compile for x86_64:

clang++ -std=c++11 -arch x86_64 -o main main.cpp -lglfw -lGLEW -framework OpenGL

3. Run the app under Rosetta 2

arch -x86_64 ./main
